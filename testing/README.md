## Notice

This folder is for testing purposes only, it's a local version of tools such as the online [C++ Shell](http://cpp.sh/), except it also allows newer C++ and compiler versions and has access to all locally installed libraries.

This folder is supposed to stay clean for testing. **Any changes made here should not be committed!**
